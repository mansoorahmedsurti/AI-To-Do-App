# [PROJECT_NAME] Constitution
<!-- Example: Spec Constitution, TaskFlow Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First
Every feature starts as a standalone library; Libraries must be self-contained, independently testable, documented; Clear purpose required - no organizational-only libraries

### II. CLI Interface
Every library exposes functionality via CLI; Text in/out protocol: stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr; Support JSON + human-readable formats

### III. Test-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced

### IV. Integration Testing
Focus areas requiring integration tests: New library contract tests, Contract changes, Inter-service communication, Shared schemas

### V. Mandatory Stack
Language: Python 3.13+, CLI: Typer, UI: Rich, Testing: Pytest, Persistence: Local JSON

### VI. Observability
Text I/O ensures debuggability; Structured logging required
